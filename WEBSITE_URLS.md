# Website Access URLs

## ✅ WORKING URL - Use This One!

**S3 Website Endpoint (Currently Working):**

**Main URL:**
```
http://attendance-frontend-1765405751.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

**Direct Login Page:**
```
http://attendance-frontend-1765405751.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/login.html
```

**Direct Sign Up Page:**
```
http://attendance-frontend-1765405751.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/signup.html
```

**Note:** 
- ✅ Currently working and tested
- ⚠️ HTTP only (not HTTPS)
- ⚠️ Make sure to include `http://` at the beginning

---

## CloudFront HTTPS URL (May Take Time to Activate)

**Main URL (HTTPS - Secure):**
```
https://d3d3y3hf5su68f.cloudfront.net
```

**Direct Login Page:**
```
https://d3d3y3hf5su68f.cloudfront.net/login.html
```

**Why use CloudFront:**
- ✅ HTTPS (secure connection)
- ✅ Works on mobile devices
- ✅ Faster loading times
- ⚠️ May take 10-15 minutes to fully activate
- ⚠️ If you get 404, try the S3 URL above instead

## Troubleshooting Access Issues

### If the link doesn't open:

1. **Check the URL Format:**
   - Make sure it starts with `http://` or `https://`
   - Copy the full URL exactly as shown above

2. **Try CloudFront URL First:**
   - Use: `https://d3d3y3hf5su68f.cloudfront.net/login.html`
   - This is the most reliable option

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Some corporate networks block S3 website endpoints
   - Try using mobile data or a different network
   - Try CloudFront URL (less likely to be blocked)

4. **Browser Issues:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try a different browser
   - Try incognito/private mode

5. **Firewall/Security Software:**
   - Some antivirus or firewall software blocks S3 endpoints
   - Temporarily disable to test
   - Use CloudFront URL instead

6. **Regional Access:**
   - The bucket is in `us-east-1` region
   - If you're far from this region, CloudFront will be faster
