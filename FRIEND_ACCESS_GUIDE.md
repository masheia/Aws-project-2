## 🔍 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Try These Steps:

#### 1. **Check the URL Format**
   - ✅ Correct: `http://attendance-frontend-1765405751.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/login.html`

   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If none of the above works, it might be:
- **Network firewall** blocking AWS S3
- **Corporate/educational network** restrictions
- **ISP blocking** (rare)

**Solution:** Ask your friend to:
1. Try on a different network (mobile data, home Wi-Fi)
2. Try on a different device (phone, tablet, different computer)
3. Contact their network administrator if on corporate/educational network

## ✅ Quick Test

To test if the URL works, try opening this in your browser:
